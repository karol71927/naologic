These filters combine fast flow rates with high loading capacity and the retention of very fine particles, extending into the sub-micron range. Can be used at temperatures up to 500°C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods. Can also be made completely transparent for subsequent microscopic examination.	10370308	Glass Filter, Grade GF10, 150 mm, 100/pk			GBS 10370308	pk	254.4400	0		14-21 Days	9	Lab Equipment & Accessories	1059	Filter Papers & Membranes	1030	Glass Microfiber Filters	N	N

The SUR-FIT Natura® Flange System signals a secure, accurate closure with a series of audible “clicks”. A simple snap-off, snap on design allows users to change the pouch quickly to match activities without removing the skin barrier from the skin. Durahesive® skin barriers are designed for people whose stoma output is mostly liquid. Unlike other skin barriers that can break down around liquid output, Durahesive® skin barriers swell up to protect the stoma. This special effect, called turtlenecking, helps create a more secure seal without harming the skin. Durahesive® skin barriers are also easy to fit, apply, and remove. They will adhere securely to the skin while showering, bathing, and swimming.	413162	Skin Barrier, Cut-to-Fit, Flexible, Tape Collar, White, 2 1/4" Flange, 5" x 5", 10/bx (Continental US Only)	v15374.jpg	https://secure.ndc-inc.com/AIMImage/iv15374.jpg	CVT 413162	bx	68.2000	5		Stock Item	4	Extended Care/Home Health	44	Incontinence 	483	Ostomy	N	N

Mild chromic sutures are specially treated for ophthalmic and cuticular applications. The manufacture of catgut raw material, consisting of long ribbons of highly selected serosal tissue, ensures: Purity of collagen for optimal tensile strength and in-vivo performance; Uniform treatment with a buffered chromium salt solution, resulting in a chromic strand with a more predictable strength and uniform in-vivo absorption; Surface smoothness to facilitate knot run-down and knot strength, due to electronic polishing of each strand. CHROMIC GUT sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in ophthalmic surgery, but not in cardiovascular or neurological surgery.

Flexible polyurethane material, thermosensitive catheter material provides optimal stiffness during insertion and softens up to 50% post-insertion for vessel conformity and patient comfort. Radiopaque polyurethane allows for quick and easy visualization during diagnostic imaging. Third infusion lumen provides a third, independent, 19G infusion lumen that can be treated as a dedicated line for blood access and fluid or medication delivery. Laser-cut side slot Improves catheter flow rates and reduces the likelihood for positional occlusion and clot formation by minimizing debris attachment. Soft, atraumatic green tip reduces the likelihood of vessel trauma during insertion.	8888345611HP	High Pressure Triple Lumen Acute Dialysis Catheter Kit, 16cm, Curved Extensions, 12 FR, 5 kit/ctn (Continental US Only)			MAL 8888345611HP	ctn	603.2100	0		14-21 Days	8	IV Products	76	IV Catheters	575	Specialty Catheters	N	N

The dressings consist of absorbent polyurethane foam sandwiched between another layer of breathable, polyurethane film with adhesive along the borders, and wound-contacting polyethylene net containing silver metal ions (Ag+). These three layers are laminated together to produce a soft, flexible and conformable wound dressing. The outside film acts as a bacterial barrier, and the silver inhibits microbial growth in the dressing, which helps to prevent colonization. Silver is added to the dressing to prevent bacterial growth within the dressing. This product contains 79 ppm of elemental silver bound within the wound dressing. Dressings provide physical separation between the wound and external environments to assist in preventing bacterial contamination of the wound. Soft, breathable outside film provides moisture vapor transmission from the foam layer for exudates management. Absorbent and conformable pad. Low-allergy gelatin-free adhesive. Wound contact layer is laminated PE net, preventing sticking to wounds. Individually packed in peel pouch and ETO sterilized.
